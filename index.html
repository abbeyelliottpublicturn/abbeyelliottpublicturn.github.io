        <p>
        Addiction to social media can look different in every individual. However, addiction is very possible. Symptoms of addiction include: being overly concerned about social media, having an uncontrollable urge to log onto the websites, and spending large amounts of time on the platforms. If the time spent on social media is shortened, those with addictions can become irritable, and the time usually spent on social media negatively affects other areas in life of these individuals.
