        <p>
        Problematic Social Media Use can be characterized by many things. Individuals that experience problematic social media use have an extreme desire to be on social media. If an individual dedicates copious amounts of time to social media that it limits other activities, they exhibit problematic social media use. These characteristics can cause addiction and symptoms of depression.
