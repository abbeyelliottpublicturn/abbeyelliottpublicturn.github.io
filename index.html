        <p>
        Problematic Social Media Use can be characterized by many things. Individuals that experience problematic social media use have an extreme desire to be on social media. If an individual dedicates copious amounts of time to social media that it limits other activities, they exhibit problematic social media use. These characteristics of this condition can cause addiction and symptoms of depression. Through examining problematic social media use and its characteristics, it is easier to see how addiction and depression symptoms can be caused by social media use.

        <p>
        Addiction to social media can look different in every individual. However, addiction is very possible. Symptoms of addiction include: being overly concerned about social media, having an uncontrollable urge to log onto the websites, and spending large amounts of time on the platforms. If the time spent on social media is shortened, those with addictions can become irritable, and the time usually spent on social media negatively affects other areas in life of these individuals.

        <p>
        Addiction is very possible through many of the features that social media platforms utilize. These include likes, followers, comments, and other interactive features that keep users looking at their notifications. In a TED Talk by Bailey Parnell, she describes how she went on a trip and thought her phone was vibrating when it was not. This shows the impact that even phone vibrations have on our minds.
